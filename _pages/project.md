## Research Projects
### Blockchain for Transactive Energy 
This project implements Blockchain technology to both secure and facilitate energy trading between DERs for Transactive Energy platform. Hyperledger Fabric is implemented onto a secure hardware chip developed by project partner ["BlockFrame"](http://www.blockframetech.com/) that sets immutable cryptographic keys for each DER asset. The underlying keys and associated Blockchain capabilities allow for proof-of-origin and proof-of-trust verification. 

### Synthetic Power Distribution Network
In this project, I created a framework to generate synthetic power distribution networks. These networks map to real geo-spatial topologies that track roads from OpenStreetMap data. Substation locations were selected from similar work that developed synthetic transmission test cases. Underlying real and reactive power in the distribution network were assigned using population information gathered from United States 2010 Census block data.
