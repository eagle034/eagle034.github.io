Hi! I'm Samrat ('Sam'). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/) at the [University of Arkansas, Fayetteville](http://www.uark.edu/) and serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in Intelligent Information Sensing and Transmission Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Jingxian Wu](https://wuj.hosted.uark.edu/). Currently, my research focus is on developing sequential analysis based optimization algorithms with applications in various fields of electrical engineering.

I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/).  During my senior year, I worked on "Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Scheme for Human Action Recognition" in my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://sites.google.com/site/drshaikhfattah/). 

My research interest includes Optimization, Machine Learning, Seuqntial Analysis, Statistical Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Pattern Recognition. My aim is to have a stimulating research-centric career concentrated on data science and algorithm development. In this site, I have shared my academic experiences and research projects. Thanks for visiting my site!
