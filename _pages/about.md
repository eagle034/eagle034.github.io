Hi. I am Md Sajjad Hossain. I am a PhD student at [University at North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.uncc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Willis](https://coefs.uncc.edu/arwillis/){:target="_blank"}

I graduated from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) with a Bachelor of Science degree from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) 



I am currently focusing on **Development of a parallel processing based Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) Electro-Magnetic(EM)
