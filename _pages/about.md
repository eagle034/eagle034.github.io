"It is not our ability that shows what we really are, it is our choices"- this quote from the Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets has always inspired to step out from my comfort zone and to face challenges. These challenges provide me a strong personal drive for academic research, commercialization, philanthropy, and education and instruction.

After finishing my undergrad from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) back in 2014, I decided to pursue the hardest path of the academic research i.e. decided to join a Ph.D. program. I decided to join [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Johnson](https://sustainability.asu.edu/person/nathan-johnson/){:target="_blank"} for [Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions (LEAPS)](https://leaps.asu.edu/) during Fall 2015. 

Joining the Ph.D. program helped me to expand my skills in different commercial software as well as in different programming languages. I got opportunities to directly with our industry partners like Incsys, XENDEE as well as academic partners like LBNL. Moreover, I am the student member of the IEEE Smart Village Technology Committee where I am in charge of developing an open source universal charge controller for off-grid areas. I am currently focusing on **synthethic distribution feeder development, application of blockchain in Transactive Energy, cyber-security of inverter dominated networks**.

I have always been a team player and like working with a different group of people. I enjoy being a leader. I am passionate about developing advanced technology solutions in an affordable way to help humanity as well as the industry.

Some personal information I'd like to share about myself:
- I am addicted to Chess and International Bridge. Please find me (**sssaha**) at [BridgeBase](https://www.bridgebase.com/){:target="_blank"} if you are interested in playing together.
- I like travelling, cooking, binge-watching tv shows. My personal favorite is and probably will always be [Person of Interest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/).

<!-- I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://electrical-engineering.uark.edu/) at the [University of Arkansas, Fayetteville](http://www.uark.edu/) (UofA) and serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Intelligent Information Sensing and Transmission Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Jingxian Wu](https://wuj.hosted.uark.edu/). My research focus is on developing sequential analysis based optimization algorithms with applications in various fields of electrical engineering. Currently, I'm working on my dissertation titled "Quickest Change Detection with Imperfect Post-change Models" with the target of graduating in May 2020.

I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) of [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/). During my senior year, I worked on "Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction Scheme for Human Action Recognition" in my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah](https://sites.google.com/site/drshaikhfattah/). After my undergrad, I came to USA in Spring 2016 to pursue my doctoral studies at the UofA. I had the opportunity to work on different kinds of projects during last 4 years. My research studies deal with Optimization, Machine Learning, Seuqntial Analysis, Statistical Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Pattern Recognition among many other topics. For now, my goal is to have a stimulating research-centric career concentrated on data science and algorithm development.  -->
