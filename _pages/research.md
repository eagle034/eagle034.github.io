### Optimized Scheduling in Communication Network:
- Formulated a scheduling strategy for information pushing system based on optimal stopping time theory to optimize the delay and energy efficiency.
- Designed Markov decision process (MDP) based multicast scheduling scheme in delay-constrained content-centric wireless networks while optimizing overall system cost.

### Low-latency Anomaly Detection:
- Developed a real-time algorithm for detecting false data injection attacks and state estimation in smart grid with dynamic models and evaluated the analytical performance of the algorithm using Markov-chain.
- Proposed a sequential algorithm for quick change point detection in a system with multiple post-change models under both bayesian and non-bayesian setting.

### Image Processing and Pattern Recognition:
- Developed algorithms for human action recognition based on spatio-temporal variations of human silhouette while applying classification methods such as kNN and SVM.
- Designed schemes for lip contour extraction using morphological reconstruction based segmentation approach with k-means clustering.
