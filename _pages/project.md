### Blockchain for Transactive Energy: 
Transactive energy has the potential to simplify the exchange of energy between the increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and other grid-edge devices. The distributed framework for transactions in an open market is unsecure, however. This project implements Blockchain technology to both secure and facilitate energy trading between DERs. Hyperledger Fabric is implemented onto a secure hardware chip developed by project partner ["BlockFrame"](http://www.blockframetech.com/) that sets immutable cryptographic keys for each DER asset. The underlying keys and associated Blockchain capabilities allow for proof-of-origin and proof-of-trust verification. Applications include transactive energy, intrusion detection, asset firmware updates, set point updates, and more.

### Synthetic Power and Water Networks
Confidentiality and security of critical infrastructure can limit researchers from accessing data on power or water networks. For decades, researchers have extensively used a small set of standardized networks with limited opportunity to experiment and scale their work to thousands of realistic use cases. This project created a framework to generate synthetic power and water distribution networks, independently and then interconnected. The networks map to real geo-spatial topologies that track roads from OpenStreetMap data. Substation locations were selected from similar work that developed synthetic transmission test cases whereas water mains were taken from actual city locational data. Underlying real and reactive power in the distribution network were assigned using population information gathered from United States 2010 Census block data. Water demand was similarly assigned based on population density. The methods illustrate how to create individual synthetic distribution feeders, and groups of feeders across entire ZIP Code, with minimal input data for any location in the United States.

<!-- ### Optimized Scheduling:
- Formulated a scheduling strategy for information pushing system based on optimal stopping time theory to optimize the delay and energy efficiency.
- Designed Markov decision process (MDP) based multicast scheduling scheme in delay-constrained content-centric wireless networks while optimizing overall system cost.
- Proposed a periodic MDP-based online policy of battery charge scheduling for grid-connected photo-voltaic systems with the objective of minimizing the long-term energy cost purchased from the grid. 

### Mobile Edge Computing:
- Presented a Deep Reinforcement Learning- based approach for optimal computation offloading and resource allocation in multi-user multi-channel mobile edge computing (MEC) systems using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.
