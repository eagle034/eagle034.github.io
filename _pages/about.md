Hi. I am Md Sajjad Hossain. I am a PhD student at [University at North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.uncc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Johnson](https://coefs.uncc.edu/arwillis/){:target="_blank"}

I graduated from the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](http://eee.buet.ac.bd/) with a Bachelor of Science degree from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) 



I am currently focusing on **Development of a parallel processing based Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) Electro-Magnetic(EM)
antenna data simulator to simulate generic 3D scenes**.

I have always been a team player and like working with a different group of people. I enjoy being a leader. I am passionate about developing advanced technology solutions in an affordable way to help humanity as well as the industry.
