This work proposes a framework to generate synthetic distribution feeders mapped to real geo-spatial topologies using available OpenStreetMap data. The synthetic power networks can facilitate power systems research and development by providing thousands of realistic use cases. The location of substations is taken from recent efforts to develop synthetic transmission test cases, with underlying real and reactive power in the distribution network assigned using population information gathered from United States 2010 Census block data. The methods illustrate how to create individual synthetic distribution feeders, and groups of feeders across entire ZIP Code, with minimal  input  data for any location in the United States. The framework also has the capability to output data in OpenDSS format to allow further simulation and analysis. The slides for this talk is also available in [PDF format](https://sssaha.github.io/files/NAPS2019.ppsx){:target="_blank"}.
