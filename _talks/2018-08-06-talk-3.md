Point-on-wave analysis is used to evaluate the behavior of Adjustable Speed Drives (ASDs) with respect to faults external to the power plant. Faults are simulated for fault type (single-phase to ground and three-phase to ground) and five different fault resistances for each type to ensure similar voltage dip between those two. Results show that power consumption stays constant at a value lower than the steady state value for a single-phase fault that occurs below a threshold voltage of 85%. For a three-phase fault, the ASD works as a constant power load above a threshold terminal voltage of 86%, but under the value the power drops to zero but not linearly as assumed in the dynamic model of an ASD. Results also show that the positive sequence real power absorption profile differs between a single-phase and three-phase fault for the same amount of voltage dip which dictates the importance of including the fault type while deriving a positive sequence model of the drive for dynamic simulation.
